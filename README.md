This is my repository for my userscripts. I host them at [openuserjs](https://openuserjs.org/users/toddmath).

## 3d_text_select.user.js

This script changes the browser's stock select styles to have a nice, customizable shadow. Also, it moves the text up and left, giving it a nice 3d effect. The browsers don't render shadow effects inside of textareas or inside of forms, so instead I color the text the same as the shadow, but of course this is customizable as well. Hope you enjoy ðŸ˜„
